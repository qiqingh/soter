# Flash the UBI image to MTD partition
# Write the UBIFS image to UBI volume
# Recognize type of passed file and start the upgrade process
# Check if passed file is a valid one for NAND sysupgrade. Currently it accepts
# 3 types of files:
# 1) UBI - should contain an ubinized image, header is checked for the proper
#    MAGIC
# 2) UBIFS - should contain UBIFS partition that will replace "rootfs" volume,
#    header is checked for the proper MAGIC
# 3) TAR - archive has to include "sysupgrade-BOARD" directory with a non-empty
#    "CONTROL" file (at this point its content isn't verified)
#
# You usually want to call this function in platform_check_image.
#
# $(1): board name, used in case of passing TAR file
# $(2): file to be checked
